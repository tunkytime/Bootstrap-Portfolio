			 <p>	
				I am a web developer with a background in eCommerce and finance. My journey to web development was unexpected.
				<br>
				I majored in finance, and the thing I enjoyed most was making PowerPoints! Creating beautiful presentations was my creative outlet, and I was great at it.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first job out of college was in banking insurance, and as you can imagine, my creative outlet vanished. The obvious next step for a would-be bank examiner was to open an Etsy shop selling stationery products. My shop has continued to grow since 2016, and I launched my own website in August 2018. 
				Creating a website led to me down a never-ending road of knowlege, growth, and self-discovery. Three years ago, I was staring down a pile of compliance reports at a bank in Idaho. Now, I'm building websites for the world to see.
