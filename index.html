							<p>
								I am a web developer with a background in eCommerce and finance. My journey to web development was unexpected.
								I majored in finance, and the thing I enjoyed most was making PowerPoints! Creating beautiful presentations
								was
								my
								creative outlet, and I was great at it.
							</p>
							<p>
								My first job out of college was in banking insurance, and as you can imagine, my creative outlet vanished. The
								obvious next step for a would-be bank examiner was to open an Etsy shop selling stationery products. My shop
								has
								continued to grow since 2016, and I launched my own website in August 2018.
								Creating a website led to me down a never-ending road of knowlege, growth, and self-discovery. Three years
								ago,
								I
								was staring down a pile of compliance reports at a bank in Idaho. Now, I'm building websites for the world to
								see.
